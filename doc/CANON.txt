<TD>CANON is a C++ library for global optimization of nonlinear models using complete search algorithms.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

The main workflow in <a>CANON</a> for global optimization of mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLP) entails:
- reading the MINLP model, for instance in <a>GAMS</a> format
- preprocessing the MINLP model by applying local search and bound-tightening techniques
- reformulating the MINLP model as an equivalent mixed-integer quadratically constrained program (MIQCP), possibly with redundant constraints
- solving the MIQCP, possibly within a refinement of piecewise relaxations for nonlinear intrinsic functions
.
The final solution step exploits the capability of the optimization solver <a>GUROBI</a> for globally optimizing nonconvex MIQCPs. The MIPOP preprocessing step relies on <a>MC++</a> to perform constraint propagation (FBBT) and to construct the polyhedral (LP) relaxations of the MIPOP for OBBT, which are solved using <a>GUROBI</a>. <a>CANON</a> also implements its own outer-approximation algorithm with feasibility pump for local MINLP search as part of preprocessing, using <a>GUROBI</a> to solve the master (MIP) subproblems and <a>SNOPT</a> to solve the primal (NLP) subproblems. \textsf{CANON} builds on the library \textsf{MC++} for the construction and manipulation of expression trees and their evaluation in various computer algebra, including the decomposition of multivariate polynomials into quadratic forms as well as the generation of redundant quadratic constraints.


\section sec_CANON_install What do I need to run CANON?

CANON is released as open source code under the <A href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html">Eclipse Public License (EPL)</A>.

CANON depends on the following third-party libraries:
- <A href="https://projects.coin-or.org/MCpp">MC++</A> (version 2.1) for construction, manipulation and bounding of factorable functions
- <A href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/SOL/snopt.htm">SNOPT</A> or <A href="https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt">IPOPT</A> for local solution of NLP problems
- <A href="http://www.gurobi.com/">Gurobi</A> for solution of LP/QP/MILP/MIQP/MIQCQP problems
- <A href="https://www.boost.org/">Boost</A> for managing the commandline and option files as well as random sampling
- <A href="hhttps://www.gams.com/">GAMS</A> for importing model files written in the GAMS language
.

On distribution, the main directory should contain the files <TT>AUTHORS</TT>, <TT>INSTALL</TT>, <TT>LICENSE</TT> and <TT>README</TT>, as well as 3 subdirectories:
- <tt>src</tt> contains the source code of CANON, which consists of header files only; that is, there is no need to build or link a library.
- <tt>doc</tt> contains the Doxygen documentation for CANON, which can be accessed by opening the file <tt>doc/html/index.html</tt> with your favorite browser.
- <tt>test</tt> contains simple examples that should help you understand how to use the types of CANON.
